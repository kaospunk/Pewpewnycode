This script lets you generate potential domain name variants using available
homoglyphs. The selection of homoglyphs is based on permitted characters for
.com registrations so it's somewhat more limited than the total possible
homoglyphs. Adding those additional variants may be done in the future as
an optional parameter.

Note: This requires python version 3
